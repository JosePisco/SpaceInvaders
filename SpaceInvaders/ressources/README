hello, welcome!

this is a space invaders reviewed.

originally a school project, it has been canceled due to the covid19 shitcase.

whatever i still finished it and dang it, it was fun.

okay so now you need a guide on how to play huh?

If you have the .exe file:
	be careful, tricks in coming : double click the .exe file (but on windows eh)

if you have a jar file, don't be excited it's not insane hacking, just jar:
	open a command prompt and type "java [filename].jar"
	if you don't know what a command prompt is go bacc to windows and run the .exe duh

if you have the project code and you are a serious person:
	for the good sake of your mental health DO NOT try to understand the following parts:
		-the DoHitBoxCollide functon, it works stop asking.
		-basically what's in the Invaders class
		-the shoot function in the Weapon class, you break, you repair motherfucker

Watch out for trash (hard?) code in Menu / Highscores classes. yea i use trash libraires leadig to trash code but fuck you.

NOTE that the music does not reflect my personal / political opinions. It was just fun with friends and all.
